# canvas-fit-margin-ts [![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

[canvas-fit](https://github.com/hughsk/canvas-fit) rewritten in Typescript.
Small module for fitting a canvas element within the bounds of its parent.
Useful, for example, for making a canvas fill the screen.

This module exports a named function that takes as input the HTMLCanvasElement
and an option object.
It has some limitations in respect of original [canvas-fit](https://github.com/hughsk/canvas-fit):

- does not work with SVG
- the resize function return `[width, height]`
- not dynamic (change the options implies to re-create).

## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/canvas-fit-margin-ts.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/canvas-fit-margin-ts/)

### resize = createFit(canvas[, options])

Creates a `resize` function for your `canvas` element. Calling this function
will resize the canvas to fit its parent element.

Here's a simple example to make your canvas update its dimensions when
resizing the window:

```typescript
import { createFit }
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas')
window.addEventListener('resize', createFit(canvas), false)
```

You might want to override the `options.parent` element that the canvas should be
fitting within: in which case, pass that element in as your second argument:

```typescript
window.addEventListener('resize', createFit(canvas, window), false)
```

You can also set the scale of the canvas element relative to its styled size
on the page using the `option.scale` field â€“ for example, passing in
`window.devicePixelRatio` here will scale the canvas resolution up on retina
displays.
